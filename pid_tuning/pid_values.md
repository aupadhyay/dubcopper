Test values:
- I, D = zerod (tune P first)
- 100ms delays
- .02 .05 .1 .15 .2
- P = .2 best so far

- 10 ms delays
- P = 0.2
- P = .15 for 50ms, 20ms, 10ms delays

- best so far:
- 10ms delays = 100Hz
- P = 0.1P

- contender:
- 10ms delays = 100Hz
- P = 0.08

- final:
- 10 ms delays = 100Hz
- P = 0.09

---
- P = 0.09
- I = 0.05 -> too strong
- I = 0.04 -> bit much
